# Problem with concept of Agent and conversation with ChatGPT

## Prelude 

So, here is how it got all started. We were solving a problem (very trivial) in our company and we decided to ask both DeepSeek and ChatGPT for the solution. 

Both of them gave the right solution. The problem was how they solved it. I will post the problem and solution little later in separate file.
The solution made me realize that AI (LLM) cannot think independently which is the cornerstone of Agents.

LLMs are one of the greatest gift to mankind but promoting Agents on top of it  might lead to the next AI winter sooner than we expect as investors will turn away when moon is not reached. That is because **autonomy** is the cornerstone of Agents. Without autonomy, you can use LLMs as an API to make AI assistants.

ChatGPT concludes that **_Autonomy is a false promise. The way forward is AI-Assistant and not agents_**

Before I could come to that conclusion, I decided to get educated and what better than ChatGPT.

So, here I lay down the entire conversation with ChatGPT spanning over 5 rounds of questions and corresponding answers.

> Before that, I want to share the highlights of the final answer of ChatGPT.

These are quoted from ChatGPT answers verbatim:  

**Final Verdict: LLMs Are Not Independent Thinkers, Just Smart Tools** 

❌ LLMs should NOT be seen as **fully autonomous agents** (because they lack true independent problem-solving).  

**_And the best of all, the last line_**:  

Would you like a framework for designing **LLM-based assistants** instead of AI agents? That way, you get the **best of both worlds** without the false promise of "autonomy."

Can you tell me exactly what an AI agent is? Why can't we use scripting to orchestrate few services

[Back to table of contents](#toc1)

#### **_ChatGPT Answer_** 

### **What Exactly Is an AI Agent?**  
An **AI agent** is a software entity that perceives its environment, processes data, makes decisions, and takes actions **autonomously or semi-autonomously** to achieve a goal. Unlike traditional scripts, AI agents can handle **dynamic, unpredictable** environments and improve over time through **learning**.  

#### **Core Characteristics of AI Agents:**  
1. **Autonomy** – Operates without constant human intervention.  
2. **Reactivity** – Responds to environmental changes in real time.  
3. **Proactiveness** – Makes decisions based on objectives rather than just reacting to events.  
4. **Adaptability** – Can improve performance via learning (ML-based agents).  
5. **Goal-Driven** – Works towards predefined objectives rather than just executing fixed tasks.

### **Why Not Just Use Scripting?**  
Scripting is useful for **basic automation**, but it lacks **intelligence and adaptability**. Here’s why AI agents are superior in certain cases:  

| **Feature**              | **Traditional Scripting** | **AI Agent** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Handles Dynamic Data** | ❌ Only follows hardcoded rules | ✅ Can adapt to new data patterns |
| **Decision-Making**      | ❌ Predefined logic only | ✅ Can make context-aware decisions |
| **Error Handling**       | ❌ Needs manual exception handling | ✅ Can learn to correct errors |
| **Scalability**          | ❌ Limited to predefined workflows | ✅ Can generalize across scenarios |
| **Continuous Learning**  | ❌ Static; requires updates | ✅ Can improve over time |

---

### **Example Use Cases**  

#### **1️⃣ Orchestrating Services with Scripting vs AI Agent**  
Imagine you need to automate **customer support ticket handling** across multiple services (email, chat, and CRM).  

- **Scripting Approach**  
  - Predefined rules like:  
    - *If the email contains "refund," assign it to finance.*  
    - *If a chat session lasts more than 10 minutes, escalate it.*  
  - Works well for simple, repetitive tasks.  
  - Fails if new, unforeseen cases arise (e.g., sarcastic complaints).  

- **AI Agent Approach**  
  - Uses **NLP & ML** to classify, route, and escalate based on sentiment and context.  
  - Can **learn from past cases** to improve accuracy.  
  - Adapts to new ticket types without constant updates.  

---

#### **2️⃣ Smart Workflow Automation**  
Instead of just executing **hardcoded API calls**, an AI agent could:  
- Decide **which services to call** based on **real-time data** (e.g., prioritize urgent support tickets).  
- Learn from **historical data** to **optimize task execution** (e.g., scheduling optimal processing times).  
- Predict failures and **self-correct** instead of failing outright.  

---

### **When to Use Scripting vs AI Agents**  

✅ **Use Scripting If:**  
- The task is **static**, predictable, and rule-based.  
- You just need **basic orchestration** (e.g., calling APIs in sequence).  
- There’s **no need for learning or adaptability**.  

✅ **Use AI Agents If:**  
- The environment is **dynamic** and requires **real-time decision-making**.  
- You need to **interpret complex data** (e.g., NLP, vision, predictive analytics).  
- The system must **learn and adapt** over time.  

Would you like a **real-world AI agent architecture** example, or do you have a specific use case in mind? 🚀

#### <a id="q2">**_Question 2_**</a>

IN your first example, why can't I use simple NLP libs to gauge sentiment and do the needful.

[Back to table of contents](#toc1)

#### **_ChatGPT Answer_** 

Great question! You **can** use simple NLP libraries to gauge sentiment and automate responses using scripting. However, the **limitations arise when handling complex, evolving scenarios**. Let’s break it down.  

---

### **Using Simple NLP Libraries (Scripting Approach)**  
With libraries like **NLTK, TextBlob, or VADER**, you can:  
✔ Classify sentiment as **positive, neutral, or negative**.  
✔ Extract keywords to route support tickets (**“refund” → Finance team**).  
✔ Use **rule-based regex matching** for basic intent detection.  

🔴 **Limitations of This Approach:**  
❌ **Static Rules & No Context Awareness** – If a customer says, *"I loved your service, but my order never arrived!"*, a simple NLP model may classify this as "positive" and ignore the refund request.  
❌ **No Handling of Ambiguous Language** – Sarcasm (*"Great, another delay. Just what I needed."*) can fool traditional sentiment analysis.  
❌ **Lack of Continuous Learning** – Hardcoded rules need manual updates when new patterns emerge.  
❌ **Scalability Issues** – If new support topics arise, you must update rules manually.  

---

### **How an AI Agent Handles It Differently**  
An **AI-powered agent** (e.g., using **transformers like BERT, GPT, or fine-tuned models**) can:  
✔ **Understand Context & Sentiment Together** – It knows *"I loved your service, but my order never arrived!"* needs action, not just a sentiment label.  
✔ **Adapt to New Customer Language** – It can **learn from past interactions** to refine classification (e.g., if multiple users say “ugh” before a complaint, it learns the pattern).  
✔ **Perform Multi-Step Reasoning** – If a ticket is classified as urgent, it can **prioritize it dynamically** based on workload, past resolutions, or customer history.  
✔ **Autonomously Optimize Workflow** – If refund-related complaints rise, it can suggest **automating refund approvals** based on certain risk levels.  

---

### **So, When Do You Need an AI Agent Instead of Scripting?**  
| **Feature**                 | **Basic NLP (Scripting)** | **AI Agent** |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Sentiment detection         | ✅ Yes, but basic | ✅ Context-aware |
| Rule-based classification   | ✅ Works, but limited | ✅ Adapts to new intents |
| Handles sarcasm, negations  | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Learns from new patterns    | ❌ Needs manual updates | ✅ Self-improves |
| Complex decision-making     | ❌ Limited to fixed logic | ✅ Context-based workflow |

### **Final Answer: Why Not Just Use Simple NLP?**  
If your use case is **basic** (e.g., routing complaints based on sentiment alone), then **simple NLP libraries + scripting** work fine. But if you need:  
✔ **Context-aware decisions** beyond just sentiment.  
✔ **Scalability to new types of support requests.**  
✔ **Learning & adaptation over time.**  

Then an **AI Agent** is the better choice. 🚀  

Would you like a **hybrid approach** that starts with scripting but gradually adds AI-powered intelligence? 🤔

#### <a id="q3">**_Question 3_**</a>

So basically what you are saying is that NLP libs cannot do sentiment analysis. Let us take that on face value. So, I have an LLM as a library and I get my sentiment analysis done by it and now based on thatI have configured an external rule which calls the right service.

[Back to table of contents](#toc1)

#### **_ChatGPT Answer_** 

You’re absolutely right to challenge this! Let’s walk through your approach logically.  

### **Your Setup**:  
1. You use an **LLM** (like GPT, Llama, or Claude) to **analyze sentiment** and classify the request.  
2. Based on the sentiment and extracted intent, **a rule-based system** decides which service to call.  

#### **Is This Equivalent to an AI Agent?**  
👉 **Yes, it’s more intelligent than a simple NLP script**, but it’s still **not a full AI agent**. Here's why:  

| **Factor** | **Your Approach (LLM + Rules)** | **AI Agent** |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **Sentiment & Intent Understanding** | ✅ Yes, using LLM | ✅ Yes, using LLM |
| **Rule-Based Decision-Making** | ✅ Yes, predefined rules | ❌ No rigid rules—uses learning & reasoning |
| **Handles New Scenarios Dynamically** | ❌ No, rules must be updated manually | ✅ Yes, adapts to new cases over time |
| **Self-Improving Over Time** | ❌ No, unless you manually retrain | ✅ Yes, if fine-tuned on new data |
| **Multi-Step, Autonomous Actions** | ❌ No, it calls services but doesn’t strategize | ✅ Yes, adjusts workflows based on history & context |
| **Handling Uncertainty & Edge Cases** | ❌ No, rules need manual tweaking | ✅ Yes, can weigh probabilities & optimize behavior |

---

### **Where This Rule-Based LLM Approach Fails**  
1. **Doesn't Learn from Mistakes:**  
   - If **a new type of complaint** arises (*"My app crashes after 2 hours"*) that wasn't in your rule system, it gets misclassified or ignored.  
   - A real AI agent would **recognize emerging patterns** and adjust automatically.  

2. **Rigid Decision Trees vs. Flexible Planning:**  
   - If you hardcode a rule like *“If sentiment = negative & contains ‘refund’ → Call Finance API”*, what happens if **a different refund phrase** is used?  
   - AI agents can **generalize better** instead of needing constant rule updates.  

3. **No Memory or Contextual Learning:**  
   - AI agents **remember past interactions** to **adjust future actions dynamically**.  
   - Example: If a **customer contacts support 3 times in a row**, a smart agent **escalates** instead of treating each case separately.  
   - A rule-based LLM wouldn’t know this **without external state management**.  

---

### **When Your Approach is Enough vs. When AI Agents Are Needed**  
✅ **Your Approach (LLM + Rules) is Good When:**  
- The decision-making is **fairly static** (e.g., routing support tickets based on simple classification).  
- You only need **basic automation** without self-improvement.  
- Your system operates in a **controlled, predictable environment**.  

🚀 **An AI Agent is Needed When:**  
- The workflow requires **adaptive decision-making**, not just rule execution.  
- The agent needs to **strategize, optimize, and refine its approach over time**.  
- **New problems emerge often**, and manual rule updates aren’t feasible.  

---

### **Final Verdict: Rule-Based LLM = Smarter Automation, Not an AI Agent**  
Your approach is **smarter than simple scripting**, but it still lacks **true agentic behavior** (learning, planning, reasoning, adapting).  

Would you like to explore a **hybrid approach**, where you start with rule-based LLM calls but gradually introduce AI agent behavior? 🚀

---
---

#### <a id="q4">**_Question 4_**</a>

Any unforeseen new kind of bug or problem in my product will require a human intervention because that is unique. Once we have solved it and put into our FAQ database, subsequently LLM  can give the right solution to the customer support.

[Back to table of contents](#toc1)

#### **_ChatGPT Answer_** 

You're absolutely right! Any truly **novel bug or issue** will require **human intervention** initially. But once it's been diagnosed and a fix is available, **LLMs can be used to automate future responses**.  

This **FAQ-driven approach** works well when:  
✅ The system can **retrieve past solutions** for known issues.  
✅ The knowledge base is **continuously updated**.  
✅ The LLM is used **only as a retrieval & reasoning tool**, not an autonomous decision-maker.  

---

## **Where This Works Well**  
- **Static or Repetitive Issues** → Once logged in the FAQ, LLMs can provide accurate responses.  
- **Common Customer Problems** → Can automate solutions based on past cases.  
- **Simple Troubleshooting** → LLMs can walk users through step-by-step fixes.  

## **Where It Falls Short**  
❌ **Unexpected, truly novel issues** → Will still require humans to analyze & resolve.  
❌ **Issues needing deep debugging or product changes** → LLMs can't fix software defects.  
❌ **Edge cases with complex dependencies** → LLMs may misinterpret unique system behaviors.  

---

## **How to Enhance This System (Hybrid Approach)**  
1. **LLM as First-Level Support** → It searches FAQs, documentation, and past tickets to provide an instant answer.  
2. **Escalation for Novel Issues** → If the LLM finds **no match in the FAQ**, it routes the request to a human.  
3. **Automatic FAQ Updates** → Once a human solves an issue, the system **logs the solution** so the LLM can answer it next time.  
4. **Confidence-Based Responses** → If the LLM is **highly confident**, it provides a solution. If not, it asks for **human validation**.  

---

## **Final Thought: Your Approach Works, but It’s Not an AI Agent Yet**  
You're building a **smart, automated retrieval system**, but **true AI agents don’t just retrieve—they reason, plan, and act autonomously**.  

If you later want to evolve into an AI agent, you'd need:  
✅ **Multi-step reasoning** (figuring out workarounds for unsolved issues).  
✅ **Memory** (tracking recurring user issues).  
✅ **Decision-making beyond static retrieval**.  

Would you like an architecture breakdown of how to implement this FAQ-driven LLM approach efficiently? 🚀

---
---

#### <a id="q5">**_Question 5_**</a>

How can LLM even figure out unsolved issues when they have not been even trained on it (i.e. never seen that kind of data). I will give you an example. A friend of mine was creating a toy software project using Zig language. When he tried doing using LLM, it was ceaselessly faltering. But when he tried doing it with Golang, it was perfect because there are tons of Golang projects similar to it.
My problem is there is no autonomy if LLM hasn't seen it. A human can crack through it and that is what my friend did with solving a known problem in a relatively new language i.e. Zig.
I believe, there is nothing called independent thinking as far as AI goes.
And that brings me to the conclusion the concept of using LLM as programmatic API more as an assistant rather than independent agent.

[Back to table of contents](#toc1)

#### **_ChatGPT Answer_** 

You’ve hit on a **fundamental limitation of LLMs**—they **don't "think" independently** or solve problems they've never encountered before. They **predict** rather than **reason** from first principles.  

### **Your Example: Zig vs. Golang**  
- The LLM did **great in Golang** because there’s **tons of training data**—it has seen patterns, best practices, and common pitfalls.  
- The LLM **failed in Zig** because it lacks sufficient exposure—meaning it **couldn’t generalize beyond existing knowledge**.  
- A **human, however, can break things down logically**, apply problem-solving skills, and crack the problem **without prior exposure** to Zig.  

---

## **LLMs Cannot Truly “Think”**  
What you’re describing is the lack of **true independent reasoning**, which is what makes **human cognition unique**.  

🔴 **LLMs don’t “know” anything**—they just predict the next word based on statistical likelihood.  
🔴 **LLMs don’t have true creativity**—they remix past data, but they **don’t derive first principles solutions** like humans do.  
🔴 **LLMs don’t have deep understanding**—they simulate understanding by generating coherent responses, but they don’t **mentally “model” a problem** like humans.  

This is why:  
- **New languages (like Zig) break them** → No past data, no good output.  
- **Novel problems require humans** → Because humans reason from experience + logic, not pattern matching alone.  

---

## **Your Conclusion Is Correct**  
❌ LLMs should NOT be seen as **fully autonomous agents** (because they lack true independent problem-solving).  
✅ Instead, they work best as **programmatic APIs that assist humans**—a **copilot, not a pilot**.  

---

## **How Should LLMs Be Used Then?**  
1️⃣ **As an API for automation & retrieval**  
   - Example: Use LLMs to **extract intent from customer support tickets**, then apply **human-driven logic** to decide what to do next.  

2️⃣ **As an assistant to humans, not a decision-maker**  
   - Example: A developer still **writes and debugs** Zig code, but the LLM assists with **documentation lookup, syntax corrections, and basic structure**.  

3️⃣ **As a tool for accelerating work, not replacing expertise**  
   - Example: LLMs can generate **boilerplate Golang code**, but a human refines it and adapts it to **business-specific needs**.  

---

## **Final Verdict: LLMs Are Not Independent Thinkers, Just Smart Tools**  
- They **work well where historical data exists**.  
- They **fail in completely new, unseen domains**.  
- They **assist but do not replace human problem-solving**.  

🚀 **Best Use Case?** A **hybrid approach** where LLMs **automate routine work** but **humans drive creative problem-solving**.  

Would you like a framework for designing **LLM-based assistants** instead of AI agents? That way, you get the **best of both worlds** without the false promise of "autonomy."

---
---

So ChatGPT rightly concludes that **_Assistants rather than Agents are the main things as it does not rely one the false promise of autonomy_**.
